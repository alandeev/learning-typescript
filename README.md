# Learning Typescript 😁

## Reason 🧾

> At the moment I am studying CSharp and getting deeper into the implementation of OO concepts, but I am still very passionate about Javascript. However, all this knowledge that I see from one and the other, led me to study TypeScript that uses the javascript language to implement OO typing and concepts. So improving the code and even avoiding possible errors due to the lack of data processing.
